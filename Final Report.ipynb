    "It’s really hard to define a good movie. Since everyone has his/her own taste. Plus, it's always a debate which movie/movies are the best of all time. This project does not intend to address this question, instead it aims to find some insights about movie sales. As a side effect, this might also suggest some 'great' movies in which \"great\" refers to movies that are the box office attraction. \n",
    "\n",
    "To explore the movie market, the first thing we need to know is which movie markets are more informative, or we are just looking at a overall situation. United States, the land that owns the famous Hollywood, would certainly be in our consideration. Meanwhile, China, the second biggest economy in the world, could be one of the candidates. Thus, we need some background context. \n",
    "\n",
    "With some navigation on the internet, here are some contexts:\n",
    "- China has grew from a total of 1,000 million USD movie sales in year 2001 to 55,900 million USD in year 2017. This is really a blast! Moreover, it becomes second biggest movie market in the world. First place? North America! \n",
    "- In the first quarter of 2018, China has surpassed North America for the first time in the history in the movie market.\n",
    "Thus, like other markets, movie sales in China becomes a big cake that everyone wants to take a share of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "With those contexts, this project will then concern on the movie sales in those two areas as well as boxoffice worldwide. "

    "Many data scientists have done similar works related to movie sales. But their focus mostly lies in the data scraping part as their main purposes are to give tutorials for those who are insterested in learning data scraping skills. Furthermore, almost all those works only consider domestic markets, sometimes even not marktets- Chinese data scientists have posted numerous online blogs for scraping data related to movie ratings and comments while data scientists in North America never care about the movie market in China. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, website https://www.boxofficemojo.com/ carries rich information about movie sales worldwide. But it only provides boxoffice, nothing else. A good strategy could be combining the boxoffice here with more detailed movie information on website https://www.imdb.com. \n",
    "Examples here:\n",
    "- https://www.statista.com/statistics/188658/movie-genres-in-north-america-by-box-office-revenue-since-1995/ \n",
    "- https://www.statista.com/statistics/645169/china-box-office-revenue-genre/\n",
    "actually captured a summary statistics for box office by genres in China and North America, but statistics for China is out of date while the change in Chinese movie market is so rapid as introduced above. Still, those could serve as a starting point for what we could do with scraped movie sales data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon data scraping, this project intends to explore first and tries to reveal more hidden information. Besides, the project will compare the boxoffice between those two big markets which might do some contribution to research in social science or business analysis. "

    "There are many websites that provide boxoffice information as well as other movie related information. However, variety methods have been used on those websites to prevent data scraping (well, this is a common scence for data scraper), so the website chosen in this project is considered to be relative easier to scrape comparing with other pages. Please see the links provided below:\n",
    "- Example page for box office: http://movie.mtime.com/boxoffice/\n",
    "- Example page for detailed information for each movie: http://movie.mtime.com/229733/\n",
    "- Example page for detailed information for each movie: http://movie.mtime.com/229733/fullcredits.html \n",
    "\n",
    "From above links, we can tell a straight forward top-down strategy to scrape the data:\n",
    "- Top layer: Get the big picture which are the movies in the top 100 list of the box office for China/ North America/ Global\n",
    "- Second layer: Embeded in the data from first layer, there are movie ids that serves as links to individual information pages, enter those pages\n",
    "- Third layer: Navigating the movie page, you can see some additional information, such as awards and actors, which should be append to movie information\n",
    "\n",
    "The first layer is the easiest part since the website stores the boxoffice as json data. Through REQUESTS and Beautiful soup, we can simulate the call made to this website and acquire the json data easily (see the provided Python code in the scraping part in file \"Final_Project_Codes_Combined.ipynb\").The second and bottom layers are a little bit trickier as the website doesn't organize them well:\n",
    "- Some titles and the corresponding contents are not seperated as different tags in the HTML file. E.g., title \"Actor\" and its values, \"Vin Disel\" for example, are written in the same level\n",
    "- Many missing values as movies could have no actors or awards or companies...\n",
    "Thus, ultilization of regular expression (re module in Python) will help a lot to parse the data into cleaner format."
